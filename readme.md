# Interactive CO2/Climate Change Awareness App
[Check out the app](https://carbon.streamlit.app/).


• Raises awareness of CO2 emission impact on global temperature and climate.
• Utilizes machine learning for visualizing and predicting future CO2 levels and temperatures.
• Empowers users to engage with and understand environmental data.
• Provides an intuitive interface for easy interaction.
• Encourages informed decision-making for climate consciousness.

 This web app provides an engaging way to explore and understand global CO2 emissions data from 1751 to the present day. The data is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

# Dependencies
Ensure you have these dependencies installed before running the Interactive CO2 Emissions Visualizer. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pandas==1.3.3
plotly==5.3.1
streamlit==1.1.0
```

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Year (1751-Present):** Use the sidebar to select a specific year of interest. Scroll over charts/maps in full screen for a better experience.

2. **Choropleth Map:** Explore a dynamic choropleth map that visualizes CO2 emissions by country over time. Hover over countries to see detailed information.

3. **Global CO2 Emissions Over Time:** View a line chart illustrating global CO2 emissions trends over the selected years.

4. **CO2 Emissions by Sector Over Time:** Delve into a stacked bar chart showcasing CO2 emissions by sector for the chosen year.

5. **Bubble Chart: CO2 Emissions vs GDP per Capita:** Investigate the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP per capita for each country, represented by a bubble chart.

6. **Trade CO2 of Top 10 Regions and Countries:** Examine the trade-related CO2 emissions of the top 10 regions and countries in the selected year through a violin plot.

## Visualization Highlights

- **Choropleth Map:** Dynamic representation of CO2 emissions by country over time.
- **Global Emissions Trend:** Line chart depicting the overall trend in global CO2 emissions.
- **Sectoral Breakdown:** Stacked bar chart showcasing CO2 emissions by sector for a specific year.
